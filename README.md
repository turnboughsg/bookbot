## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

BookBot prints a report on your book or text file. The report includes simple stats like total words in the text, the counts for each letter found, and the most common letter.

## 💭 How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot first reads the text from the file and then counts the number of words, number of each letter occurence, and most frequently occurring letter.

The bot then prints a report summary of its findings.
